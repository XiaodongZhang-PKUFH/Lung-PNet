Lung-PNet is an end-to-end deep transfer learning network designed for the diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinomas (IAC) in pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs) on non-enhancement high-resolution CT (HRCT). 

The objective of Lung-PNet is to develop and validate an end-to-end 3D deep learning model pipeline for the detection of IAC histologic subtypes of pGGNs. 

Lung-PNet was developed in a retrospective study to automatically segment pGGN lesions and classify IAC subtypes in a single-center lung CT image of patients who underwent surgical resection for pulmonary nodules between January 2019 and June 2022. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using a Dice score to measure its ability to detect and segment pGGNs, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to measure its ability to classify pGGNs.
